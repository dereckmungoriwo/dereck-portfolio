    <h2 class="resume-heading">Blending Culinary Mastery with Data-Driven Innovation</h2>

    <p>
      Throughout my significant tenure in the culinary world, I have mastered technique, precision,
      creativity, and the discipline required to thrive in high-pressure environments. Yet from the beginning,
      I felt drawn to something deeper—the science behind exceptional cuisine and the systems that make
      great kitchens truly efficient.
    </p>

    <h3 class="sub-heading">I’ve always asked why:</h3>
    <ul class="why-list">
      <li>Why do certain dishes succeed?</li>
      <li>How can operations run smarter?</li>
      <li>Where can technology elevate the food industry beyond tradition?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These questions led me to expand my expertise beyond the kitchen. As the industry evolved, so did I—
      studying Supply Chain Management and completing professional Data Science training. Today I operate at a 
      rare intersection: hands-on culinary mastery combined with analytical, technical, and operational insight.
    </p>

    <p>
      With proficiency in Python, SQL, Power BI, and modern analytics tools, I build solutions that strengthen
      kitchen operations. From real-time food-cost dashboards and predictive inventory models to menu engineering
      insights and sales forecasting—I uncover patterns, optimize decision-making, and transform operations.
    </p>

    <p>
      The global food landscape is shifting toward intelligent, technology-driven systems. I am positioned to
      bridge that gap—bringing together culinary excellence, operational precision, and data-driven strategy.
