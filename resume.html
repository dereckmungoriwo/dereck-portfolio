  <!-- ===== SUMMARY ===== -->
  <section class="resume-section">
    <h2 class="resume-heading">Professional Summary</h2>
    <p>
      I am a multidisciplinary Culinary Professional and Data Analyst with extensive experience in high-volume kitchens,
      fine dining, and data-driven operational optimization. My expertise bridges classical culinary training with modern
      analytics, enabling me to design cost-efficient menus, streamline kitchen workflows, and transform operational data
      into actionable insights.
      <br><br>
      With a strong foundation in food production, supply chain management, and data science, I bring a unique perspective
      to hospitality and food operations — combining precision, creativity, and measurable performance. I thrive in fast-paced
      environments where quality, consistency, and efficiency are non-negotiable, guided by a mindset of continuous
      improvement through evidence-based decision-making.
