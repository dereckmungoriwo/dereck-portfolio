    <section class="resume-section">
      <h2 class="resume-heading">Professional Summary</h2>
      <p>
        I am a Culinary Professional and Data Analyst operating at the intersection of food, operations, and technology.
        With six years of hands-on kitchen experience and formal training in Supply Chain Management and Data Science,
        I specialize in blending culinary expertise with analytical insights. I use Python, SQL, Excel, and dashboarding tools
        to streamline operations, optimize inventory, enhance menu performance, reduce waste, and support data-driven decision making.
        I bridge the gap between kitchen execution and modern food-tech innovation.
